# SDK quickstart

Work in meters. Use radians for rotations and revolute limits.

Each `Part` is one rigid body. Add one or more named shapes to it. A shape can be a
`build123d.Shape` or `MeshGeometry`. Apply build123d `Pos`, `Rot`, or `Location` before you add
the shape. There is no second shape transform.

```python
from build123d import Box, Pos

from mini_articraft.sdk import ArticulatedObject, TestContext, TestReport


model = ArticulatedObject("small_table")
body = model.part("body")
body.add(Box(0.8, 0.5, 0.04), name="top", color=(0.45, 0.24, 0.10))
body.add(Pos(X=0.36, Y=0.21, Z=-0.36) * Box(0.04, 0.04, 0.7), name="leg_1")

object_model = model


def run_tests() -> TestReport:
    ctx = TestContext(object_model)
    return ctx.report()
```

Every shape needs a unique name within its part. A color can contain RGB or RGBA values from
zero through one.

Within one rigid part, overlapping shapes count as connected -- notice `leg_1` overlaps up into
`top` above. To attach a handle, spout, or any protrusion, extend the protrusion's own end a few
millimeters into the form it meets; it then reads as one molded piece with no extra geometry.

Use `model.articulation(...)` for fixed, revolute, continuous, and prismatic motion. Use named
shape arguments in exact checks when a part contains several shapes.

Detailed build123d pages are under `docs/sdk/build123d/`. Start with
`docs/sdk/build123d/key_concepts_algebra.md` for object algebra,
`docs/sdk/build123d/moving_objects.md` for placement,
`docs/sdk/build123d/operations.md` for solid operations, and
`docs/sdk/build123d/topology_selection.md` for selecting faces and edges.
The copied build123d examples may use arbitrary dimensions. Convert every dimension to meters in
mini-articraft.

Use the reference pages for API discovery. Use short `exec_command` inspections after authoring to
measure bounds, distances, collisions, and posed geometry.

Read only the executable example closest to the current task:

- Hollow shell: `docs/sdk/examples/hollow_shell.py`.
- Section loft with a swept wire: `docs/sdk/examples/section_loft_with_wires.py`.
- Mixed build123d and mesh assembly: `docs/sdk/examples/mixed_articulated_assembly.py`.
- Molding a handle/protrusion into a body (no mounting pads):
  `docs/sdk/examples/molded_mug.py`.
- Seating radial blades into a hub disk and welding into one rotor:
  `docs/sdk/examples/bladed_rotor.py`.

Run `compile` after meaningful edits. Treat checks as design evidence. A failed check is not a
reason to remove or simplify geometry that the prompt requires.
