# Testing geometry and assemblies

`TestContext` records checks against an `ArticulatedObject`. The checks use the same named
shapes, part transforms, and meter scale that the USDZ exporter uses.

Every `main.py` must define `run_tests()` and return a `TestReport`.

```python
from mini_articraft.sdk import TestContext, TestReport


def run_tests() -> TestReport:
    ctx = TestContext(object_model)
    ctx.expect_contact("base", "arm", shape_a="top_plate", shape_b="arm_foot")
    ctx.expect_gap(
        "shade",
        "bulb",
        axis="z",
        positive_shape="rim",
        negative_shape="glass",
        min_gap=0.002,
        max_gap=0.008,
    )
    return ctx.report()
```

Use authored checks for facts that are important to the requested object. The compiler adds the
baseline checks described below. See [USDZ export](50_usdz_export.md) for the output that a
passing report can produce.

## Units and geometry

All positions, distances, gaps, tolerances, and prismatic pose values use meters. Revolute and
continuous pose values use radians.

Collision and distance checks convert each shape to a triangle mesh. `MeshGeometry` uses its
authored vertices and faces. A build123d shape is tessellated with the context's
`mesh_tolerance`, which defaults to `0.001` meter.

World bounds are axis aligned. Projection checks therefore measure world bounds, not the exact
curved surface between those bounds.

## Creating a context

```python
ctx = TestContext(object_model, mesh_tolerance=0.001)
```

`model` must be an `ArticulatedObject`. `mesh_tolerance` must be positive and finite.

Part arguments accept a `Part` or its name. Shape arguments use the unique shape name within the
given part. A missing part or shape raises `ValidationError`.

## Reports

### `TestFailure`

```python
TestFailure(name: str, details: str, kind: FailureKind = FailureKind.AUTHORED)
```

Each blocking failure has the recorded check name and a detail string. `kind` is a
machine-readable `FailureKind` assigned by the check method (for example `OVERLAP`,
`CONTACT`, or `ISOLATED_PART`); checks authored with `check()`/`fail()` always record
`FailureKind.AUTHORED`. When the compile worker merges authored checks with its baseline,
it adds `source="tests"` or `source="compiler"` to the serialized failure. Provenance is
owned by that boundary rather than by model-authored test code.

### `AllowedOverlap`

```python
AllowedOverlap(
    part_a: str,
    part_b: str,
    reason: str,
    shape_a: str | None = None,
    shape_b: str | None = None,
)
```

The report uses this record for each overlap allowance. The context sorts the two part names so
the same pair has one stable representation. It swaps the shape names at the same time.

### `DistanceFinding`

```python
DistanceFinding(
    part_a: str,
    part_b: str,
    shape_a: str | None,
    shape_b: str | None,
    distance: float,
    nearest_a: tuple[float, float, float] | None = None,
    nearest_b: tuple[float, float, float] | None = None,
    collided: bool = False,
)
```

`distance_between()` returns this record. A collision has distance zero. The nearest points can
be absent when the mesh collision library does not provide them.

Collision assertion methods return `bool`. They put collision details in the
recorded failure instead of returning another result type.

### `TestReport`

```python
TestReport(
    passed: bool,
    checks_run: int,
    checks: tuple[str, ...],
    failures: tuple[TestFailure, ...],
    warnings: tuple[str, ...] = (),
    allowances: tuple[str, ...] = (),
    allowed_isolated_parts: tuple[str, ...] = (),
    allowed_overlaps: tuple[AllowedOverlap, ...] = (),
)
```

`passed` is true when there are no blocking failures. Warnings and allowances do not make a
report fail. `checks_run` counts recorded checks. Calling `warn()` or an allowance method does
not increase that count.

### Reporting methods

```python
ctx.check(name, ok, details="")
ctx.fail(name, details)
ctx.warn(text)
report = ctx.report()
```

`check()` records a blocking failure when `ok` is false. `fail()` always records a blocking
failure and returns false. `warn()` records a nonblocking message and ignores an exact duplicate.
`report()` returns the checks recorded so far.

## Poses

Use `pose()` to apply temporary articulation positions.

```python
rest = ctx.part_world_position("slider")
with ctx.pose({slide: 0.12}):
    extended = ctx.part_world_position("slider")
    ctx.expect_gap("slider", "stop", axis="x", min_gap=0.003)

assert ctx.part_world_position("slider") == rest
```

The signature is:

```python
ctx.pose(
    articulation_positions: Mapping[object, float] | None = None,
    **positions: float,
)
```

Mapping keys can be articulation objects or articulation names. Keyword names are articulation
names. Every value must be finite. A prismatic value translates along its authored axis. A
revolute or continuous value rotates around its authored axis. A fixed articulation ignores its
value.

The context restores the previous pose when the `with` block ends. Nested pose blocks therefore
restore the pose that was active before each block.

`pose()` does not clamp values to `MotionLimits`. Use positions that are valid for the design.

## World inspection

These methods read the current pose and do not record a check.

### `part_world_position(part) -> Vec3`

Returns the part origin in world coordinates. This is the articulation frame position, not the
center of the part geometry.

### `part_world_bounds(part) -> tuple[Vec3, Vec3]`

Returns the minimum and maximum world coordinates for all named shapes in the part.

### `shape_world_bounds(part, shape) -> tuple[Vec3, Vec3]`

Returns the world bounds for one named shape.

### `distance_between(part_a, part_b, *, shape_a=None, shape_b=None) -> DistanceFinding`

Returns the smallest mesh distance among the selected shapes. You can scope either side or both
sides. With no shape names, the query checks every shape pair between the two parts.

The two part arguments can name the same part. The selected sets must contain at least two
different shapes. Naming both shapes is the clearest form. A query that selects one shape against
itself raises `ValidationError`.

These methods are useful in a short `exec_command` inspection.

```python
from main import object_model
from mini_articraft.sdk import TestContext

ctx = TestContext(object_model)
print(ctx.shape_world_bounds("housing", "shell"))
print(ctx.distance_between("housing", "door", shape_a="rim", shape_b="panel"))
```

## Exact collision and distance checks

Every method in this section records one check and returns true on pass or false on failure. The
optional `name` replaces the generated check name.

### `expect_no_collision(part_a, part_b, *, shape_a=None, shape_b=None, name=None)`

Passes when the selected triangle meshes do not collide. This is a direct collision test. It does
not use the compiler's meaningful overlap thresholds.

### `expect_collision(part_a, part_b, *, shape_a=None, shape_b=None, name=None)`

Passes when at least one selected shape pair collides. If several pairs collide, the report uses a
representative pair with the largest bounds overlap.

### `expect_contact(part_a, part_b, *, shape_a=None, shape_b=None, contact_tol=1e-6, name=None)`

Passes when the selected geometry collides or its minimum distance is at most `contact_tol`.
`contact_tol` must be nonnegative and uses meters.

### `expect_distance(part_a, part_b, *, shape_a=None, shape_b=None, min_distance=0.0, max_distance=None, name=None)`

Passes when the minimum mesh distance is at least `min_distance` and no more than
`max_distance`, when an upper bound is provided. Both bounds are inclusive and nonnegative. A
collision has distance zero. An upper bound below the lower bound records a failed check.

Shape selectors are independent for these methods. For example, `shape_a="shaft"` can be checked
against every shape in `part_b`.

## Exact bounds checks

These checks use world axis aligned bounds. They do not prove mesh contact or mesh collision.

### `expect_gap(positive_part, negative_part, *, axis, positive_shape=None, negative_shape=None, min_gap=None, max_gap=None, max_penetration=None, name=None)`

The signed gap is:

```text
positive bounds minimum on axis minus negative bounds maximum on axis
```

`axis` must be `"x"`, `"y"`, or `"z"`. A positive result is a gap. A negative result is bounds
penetration.

When `min_gap` is omitted, the lower bound is zero. If `max_penetration` is provided, the lower
bound is `-max_penetration`. A provided `min_gap` takes precedence. `max_gap` is an optional
inclusive upper bound. An upper bound below the lower bound records a failed check.

### `expect_within(inner_part, outer_part, *, inner_shape=None, outer_shape=None, axes="xy", margin=0.0, name=None)`

Passes when the inner bounds stay inside the outer bounds on every requested axis. `margin`
allows the inner bounds to extend that far beyond the outer bounds and must be nonnegative.

### `expect_overlap(part_a, part_b, *, shape_a=None, shape_b=None, axes="xy", min_overlap=0.0, name=None)`

Passes when the projected bounds overlap by at least `min_overlap` on every requested axis. A
minimum of zero allows exact bounds contact. `min_overlap` must be nonnegative.

For `axes`, use a string such as `"xy"` or a sequence such as `("x", "z")`. Repeated axes are
ignored. At least one axis is required.

`expect_overlap()` proves projected overlap only. It does not declare an allowance and does not
suppress the compiler's mesh overlap check.

## Allowances

Allowances describe intentional exceptions to compiler owned physical checks. Each reason must be
nonempty.

### `allow_overlap(part_a, part_b, *, reason, shape_a, shape_b)`

Both shape names are required. The allowance covers only that exact named shape
pair.

```python
ctx.allow_overlap(
    "shaft",
    "hub",
    shape_a="steel_shaft",
    shape_b="bore_liner",
    reason="The shaft is captured inside the bearing liner.",
)
```

An allowance does not hide another collision between the same two parts.

An overlap allowance affects only `fail_if_parts_overlap_in_current_pose()`, including the copy of
that check which the compiler runs. It does not make `expect_no_collision()` or another authored
check pass.

Pair an allowance with an exact check that explains the intended relationship. For a captured
shaft, an `expect_contact()`, `expect_within()`, or bounds gap check can provide that evidence.

### `allow_isolated_part(part, *, reason)`

Allows one named part in `fail_if_isolated_parts()`. If several touching parts form one floating
group, every part in that group must have an allowance. The check still records a nonblocking
warning that the group was allowed.

An isolation allowance does not affect disconnected shapes inside one rigid part.

## Compiler owned checks

The compile worker runs `run_tests()` first. It then copies authored overlap and isolation
allowances into a new context and runs these baseline checks before export:

1. `check_model_valid()`
2. `check_single_root_part()`
3. `fail_if_isolated_parts()`
4. `warn_if_part_contains_disconnected_geometry_islands()`
5. `warn_if_absurd_dimensions()`
6. `fail_if_parts_overlap_in_current_pose()`

If model validity or the root check fails, the worker stops the rest of the baseline pass. When the
object is valid enough to export, the worker saves the USDZ even if another blocking check fails.
The failed check still makes the compile fail and prevents final publication.

The merged report keeps one copy of each check name. A compiler failure replaces an authored
failure with the same name. A passing compiler check never erases an authored failure. Exact
duplicate failures, warnings, and allowance strings are also merged.

### Model validity and root policy

`check_model_valid()` calls `object_model.validate()`. The object must contain valid named
geometry and form one rooted articulation tree. `check_single_root_part()` records the root policy
as its own check.

### Physical isolation

`fail_if_isolated_parts(*, contact_tol=1e-6, name=None)` builds a physical contact graph at the
current pose. Two parts are connected when their meshes collide or their minimum distance is no
more than `contact_tol`. An articulation by itself does not count as physical support.

The graph starts at the root part from the articulation tree. A physically separate group fails
unless every part in that group has an isolation allowance. Parent and child parts are checked in
the same way as any other pair.

### Disconnected geometry within a part

`warn_if_part_contains_disconnected_geometry_islands(*, contact_tol=1e-6, name=None)` splits all
named shapes into mesh components. Components are connected when they collide or are within the
contact tolerance. The compiler records a warning when one rigid part contains more than one
physical group.

Disconnected geometry is nonblocking in the baseline pass. Use the blocking form when one of your
design requirements needs it:

```python
ctx.fail_if_part_contains_disconnected_geometry_islands(contact_tol=1e-6)
```

Nested closed solids with positive volume intersection count as connected geometry.

### Scale warnings

`warn_if_absurd_dimensions(*, max_dimension=1000.0, outlier_ratio=100.0, name=None)` checks the
largest world bounds span of every named shape. It warns when a shape is larger than
`max_dimension` meters. It also warns when a shape is more than
`outlier_ratio` times the median positive shape span.

This check is always nonblocking.

### Meaningful overlap

`fail_if_parts_overlap_in_current_pose(*, overlap_tol=0.005, overlap_volume_tol=5e-7, name=None)`
checks every named shape pair from different parts at the current pose, including adjacent parent
and child parts.

A pair is a blocking overlap only when all of these facts are true:

1. Its world bounds overlap by more than `overlap_tol` on all three axes.
2. Its bounds overlap volume is greater than `overlap_volume_tol` cubic meters.
3. The triangle meshes collide.
4. No matching overlap allowance exists.

Mere contact passes. Bounds penetration at or below either physical threshold also passes. A
shape allowance suppresses only its exact pair. The report includes at most one representative
unallowed shape pair for each part pair, chosen by overlap depth and volume.

The baseline check uses the rest pose. Use `with ctx.pose(...)` and an authored exact check when a
different pose is important to the requested mechanism.

## Choosing checks

Checks are design evidence. Do not delete or simplify visible geometry only to make a check pass.

Use shape names when a part contains unrelated regions. Use a small number of checks that prove
the important support, clearance, insertion, or motion. If a check finds a real defect, repair the
geometry, articulation, pose, or exact selector. Add an allowance only when the physical
relationship is intentional.
