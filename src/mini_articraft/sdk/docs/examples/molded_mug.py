"""Attach a protrusion by molding it into the body -- no mounting pads.

A handle, spout, leg, or arm joins a body as one continuous molded piece. Shape the
protrusion's own end so it overlaps the body, then blend them. This mug shows the
geometry pattern with a handle:

  1. Sweep the handle as a loop whose two ends sit a few mm INSIDE the body wall.
  2. `weld(body, handle)` builds a smooth transition across the overlap.
  3. Add the single welded result to the part.

Do not bridge the handle to the body with a separate mounting pad, boss, or bracket.
The handle's own end reaches into the body and the weld generates the final surface.
