# Section lofts

Use `section_loft(...)` when a form is described by ordered three dimensional
cross sections. This helper can reconcile different point counts, align
section loops, follow a guide path, interpolate smooth spans, close a section
loop, and mirror a half form.

All coordinates and path values use meters.

This page documents `LoftSection`, `SectionLoftSpec`, `section_loft`, and
`repair_loft`.

```python
from mini_articraft.sdk import (
    LoftSection,
    SectionLoftSpec,
    repair_loft,
    section_loft,
)
```

Use `LoftGeometry` instead when all profiles already have the same point count
and need only a direct connection. Read [mesh geometry and solid
builders](00_mesh_geometry.md) for that lower level builder.

## LoftSection

```python
LoftSection(
    points: tuple[tuple[float, float, float], ...],
)
```

`points` is one ordered section loop. Every point must contain three finite
values. At least three points must remain after consecutive duplicates and a
repeated final endpoint are removed.

The constructor removes consecutive duplicate points. It also removes a final
point that exactly repeats the first point. You may provide either an explicitly
closed loop or a loop whose final edge is implied.

Keep the point order consistent around the shape. The loft aligns winding and
cyclic starting offsets, but clear correspondence still produces the most
predictable surface.

## SectionLoftSpec

```python
SectionLoftSpec(
    sections: tuple[LoftSection, ...],
    path: tuple[tuple[float, float, float], ...] | None = None,
    cap: bool = True,
    symmetry: Literal["mirror_yz"] | None = None,
    repair: Literal["off", "mesh"] = "off",
    interpolation: Literal["linear", "catmull_rom"] = "linear",
    samples_per_span: int = 1,
    close_path: bool = False,
    align_sections: bool = True,
    parameterization: Literal["uniform", "chord", "centripetal"] = "uniform",
    tension: float = 0.0,
    cap_style: Literal["flat", "round"] = "flat",
    cap_segments: int = 6,
    cap_length: float | None = None,
    orient_to_path: bool = False,
    frame_mode: Literal["parallel_transport", "fixed_up"] = "parallel_transport",
    up_hint: tuple[float, float, float] = (0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
)
```

At least two sections are required. The constructor also accepts section values
that can be converted to `LoftSection`.

The fields have these meanings.

- `sections` defines the ordered cross sections from the first end to the last
  end.
- `path` optionally offsets the intermediate sections along a polyline. It must
  contain at least two finite points.
- `cap` requests end caps.
- `symmetry="mirror_yz"` mirrors the result across the YZ plane by reversing
  X.
- `repair="off"` returns the generated loft directly. Set `repair="mesh"` only
  when you need the optional cleanup pass.
- `interpolation` selects straight or smooth spans between authored sections.
- `samples_per_span` controls the number of generated rings in each span.
- `close_path=True` connects the final section back to the first section.
- `align_sections=False` preserves the authored starting point of each loop.
- `parameterization` controls how Catmull Rom interpolation responds to uneven
  spacing between section centers.
- `tension` controls the strength of the smooth tangents from `0.0` to `1.0`.
- `cap_style="round"` builds rounded ends as part of the loft. `cap_segments`
  controls their density. `cap_length` controls how far each end extends.
- `orient_to_path=True` rotates each section plane to follow the path tangent.
  `frame_mode` and `up_hint` control its roll.

### Path behavior

The path always changes section positions. Set `orient_to_path=True` when each
section plane should also follow the path tangent.

For each section, the helper samples a point at the matching fraction along the
path. It compares that point with the same fraction along the straight line
from the path start to the path end. The difference becomes a translation for
that section.

Use a path when the section centers should bow or deviate from a straight loft.
With `orient_to_path=False`, the authored section planes keep their original
orientation. With `orient_to_path=True`, parallel transport gives smooth roll
through bends. Use `frame_mode="fixed_up"` when a stable global up direction is
more important than minimum twist.

### Interpolation behavior

Linear interpolation connects corresponding points with straight spans. This
is the default and preserves the earlier behavior.

Catmull Rom interpolation fits a smooth path through corresponding points in
the authored sections. Set `samples_per_span` above one to add intermediate
rings. Every authored section remains part of the result.

`parameterization="uniform"` gives every authored span equal weight.
`"chord"` uses the distance between section centers. `"centripetal"` uses the
square root of that distance and is often the safest smooth choice when section
spacing changes sharply. Higher `tension` reduces the tangent strength. A value
of `1.0` eases each span with zero tangent at its ends.

Smooth interpolation can extend outside a straight section span. This is
useful for soft product forms, but it may create an unwanted bulge when two
sections change sharply. Add a control section near that change or use linear
interpolation for that form.

With `close_path=True`, the last section connects to the first and the helper
does not add end caps. At least three sections are required. The authored
profiles should describe one continuous loop.

### Section alignment

The helper resamples every section to the largest section point count. It
samples points by distance around each closed perimeter.

With `align_sections=True`, it then reverses a loop when its normal opposes the
previous loop and chooses the cyclic point offset that best matches the
previous loop.

Set `align_sections=False` when each authored starting point has a specific
meaning, such as the leading edge of several blade profiles. The helper still
resamples the loops to a shared point count and corrects reversed winding. It
does not rotate the point order around a loop.

## section_loft

```python
section_loft(
    spec: SectionLoftSpec
    | Sequence[LoftSection | Sequence[Sequence[float]]],
    /,
    **overrides,
) -> MeshGeometry
```

The first argument can be a `SectionLoftSpec` or a raw sequence of section
loops. Raw sections use all default spec values.

Keyword overrides replace fields on the resolved spec for this call. Use only
the field names listed on `SectionLoftSpec`. An unknown field raises
`TypeError`.

The helper creates a closed side loop between every pair of sections. It caps
the result when `cap=True`. With `close_path=True`, it also creates the final
span back to the first section and omits caps.

For `symmetry="mirror_yz"`, the helper mirrors the mesh across X. If the first
half is watertight, Manifold unions the two halves. If it is open, the helper
merges the triangle lists without a boolean union. Author a half form that
meets the YZ plane when you want one connected symmetric result.

### Raw section example

```python
housing = section_loft(
    [
        [
            (-0.05, -0.03, 0.00),
            (0.05, -0.03, 0.00),
            (0.05, 0.03, 0.00),
            (-0.05, 0.03, 0.00),
        ],
        [
            (-0.035, -0.025, 0.10),
            (0.035, -0.025, 0.10),
            (0.035, 0.025, 0.10),
            (-0.035, 0.025, 0.10),
        ],
    ]
)
```

### Path and symmetry example

```python
lower = LoftSection(
    (
        (0.00, -0.04, 0.00),
        (0.05, -0.04, 0.00),
        (0.05, 0.04, 0.00),
        (0.00, 0.04, 0.00),
    )
)
middle = LoftSection(
    (
        (0.00, -0.03, 0.10),
        (0.04, -0.03, 0.10),
        (0.04, 0.03, 0.10),
        (0.00, 0.03, 0.10),
    )
)
upper = LoftSection(
    (
        (0.00, -0.02, 0.20),
        (0.025, -0.02, 0.20),
        (0.025, 0.02, 0.20),
        (0.00, 0.02, 0.20),
    )
)

spec = SectionLoftSpec(
    sections=(lower, middle, upper),
    path=((0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.02, 0.0, 0.10), (0.0, 0.0, 0.20)),
    symmetry="mirror_yz",
    interpolation="catmull_rom",
    samples_per_span=5,
    parameterization="centripetal",
    tension=0.15,
    orient_to_path=True,
    cap_style="round",
    cap_segments=8,
    cap_length=0.012,
)
housing = section_loft(spec)
```

## repair_loft

```python
repair_loft(
    geometry_or_spec: MeshGeometry
    | SectionLoftSpec
    | Sequence[LoftSection | Sequence[Sequence[float]]],
    /,
    *,
    repair: Literal["off", "mesh"] = "mesh",
) -> MeshGeometry
```

For a `MeshGeometry` input, `repair="off"` returns a copy. `repair="mesh"` runs
mesh cleanup on a copy.

For a spec or raw section input, the helper calls `section_loft(...)` with the
requested repair mode.

Mesh cleanup removes duplicate faces, degenerate faces, and unused vertices.
If the mesh is not watertight, it also merges coincident vertices and repeats
the face cleanup. It then fixes face normals.

Repair does not guarantee a watertight result. It does not fill a large missing
surface or infer a better section order. Fix invalid section geometry first.

```python
clean = repair_loft(housing, repair="mesh")
```

## Validation and common failures

- A section with fewer than three points after consecutive duplicate and final
  endpoint cleanup raises `ValidationError`. Repeated nonconsecutive points can
  pass construction and then fail the loft area check.
- A section with zero planar area fails while the loft is built.
- A spec with fewer than two sections raises `ValidationError`.
- A path with fewer than two points raises `ValidationError`.
- A path or section with nonfinite coordinates raises `ValidationError`.
- The only symmetry mode is `"mirror_yz"`.
- Repair modes are `"off"` and `"mesh"`.
- Interpolation modes are `"linear"` and `"catmull_rom"`.
- Parameterization modes are `"uniform"`, `"chord"`, and `"centripetal"`.
- Tension must be between zero and one.
- `samples_per_span` must be at least one.
- Cap styles are `"flat"` and `"round"`. Rounded caps need at least two
  segments and a positive length when one is supplied.
- Path orientation needs a path, a nonzero span between the first and last
  section centers, and an open loft path.
- Adjacent loft section centers must differ after path adjustment.
- A closed path requires at least three sections.

When a loft twists, check section order and point correspondence before adding
more sections. When caps fail, make the end sections planar and give them a
clear nonzero area.
