"""Public SDK for authoring and testing articulated objects.

One canonical import path per category:

- Object and articulation modeling, geometry classes, physical testing, and
  errors live here at the package root.
- Advanced mesh authoring and repair recipes (booleans, welds, snapping,
  profile/wire sampling, sweep helpers, section lofts, shell partitioning,
  refinement) live under ``mini_articraft.sdk.mesh``.
- USDZ publication lives under ``mini_articraft.sdk.export`` so importing the
  root SDK does not eagerly load OpenUSD.
