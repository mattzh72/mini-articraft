{{ prompt }}

Edit `main.py` in the run workspace and build the requested object. Meet the four
quality requirements from the system prompt. Use realistic geometry, model the
primary mechanism, support every part, and avoid unintended overlap.

Start with the preloaded SDK quickstart. Before choosing a representation, use
`read` to survey the relevant SDK references and compare plausible build123d and
mesh approaches. Do not stop at the first workable API. Research enough to form
an internal geometry strategy for the major visible forms. Then implement the
object with `Part.add(shape, name=..., color=...)`, add prompt-specific checks,
and run `compile`.

Treat every compile signal as design evidence. Preserve prompt-critical visible
geometry while you repair named defects. After a successful compile, review the
visual representation separately and improve any major form that uses a crude
substitute when a public authoring method would fit it better. Then return a short
visible summary of the object and its main motion.
