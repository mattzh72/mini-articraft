mini-articraft is a small agent that turns a prompt into an articulated 3D object.

The agent writes a Python model. It compiles and checks the geometry. It exports a posable USDZ
file. To make objects directly, read about the [mesh authoring SDK](docs/sdk.md). To understand
the generation loop, read the [agent design](docs/agent.md).

## Quickstart

### Install and run mini-articraft

Install the package and the development tools:

```shell
uv sync --group dev
```

Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Generate an object:

```shell
uv run mini-articraft "a jet engine"
```

Each run is in the `runs/` directory. Open a completed run in the browser viewer:

```shell
uv run mini-articraft view runs/<run-id>
```

Use the viewer to examine each generated version and move its joints.

### Run the checks

```shell
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
```
